# Installation

- Clone the repository 
- `cd` into the cloned directory
- run `poetry install`
- Optional: run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment. This will give you syntax highlighting, if you are using `vim` (or `neovim`).

# Running the code

```
poetry run python src/google_drive_v2.py
```
